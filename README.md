# Temperature API

## Overview

Temperature API is a lightweight Fabric library providing a consistent way for mods to read, modify, and react to entity/environment temperature. WIP.

The API provides a prebuilt system that you can easily integrate into your mod. Or you can build out your own custom systems with it. The choice is yours!
