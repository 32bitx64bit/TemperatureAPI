### TODO

Body temperature system API. Allows mod developers to get information on the players body temp. 

Is player soaked API. Allowed mod developers to get information on if the player has been in water, rained on, or snowed on. (soaked status)

Cold resistance / heat resistance API. Allow developers to add items that give / take away cold / heat resistance. (resistance would make the body temperature more stable in hotter / colder climates. up to developers on how to implement into their temperature systems though...)
