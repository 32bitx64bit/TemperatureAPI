# Temperature API

## Overview

Temperature API is a lightweight Fabric library providing a consistent way for mods to read, modify, and react to entity/environment temperature. WIP.

The API provides a prebuilt system that you can easily intergrat into your mod. Or you can build out your own custom temperature system with it. The choice is yours!
